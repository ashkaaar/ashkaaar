mood: low latency  
stack: duct-taped, distributed, and mostly alive

â€”

I wire strange systems together until they do something intelligent.  
No dashboards. No drag-and-drop. Just raw compute, real-time pipelines, and dumb hacks that work.

sometimes I:
- build infra no one notices â€” until it breaks
- ship AI tools that hallucinate responsibly
- prototype fast enough to outrun the docs

â†’ [AI Code Reviewer](https://github.com/ashkaaar/AI-code-review) â€” code ghost for PRs  
â†’ Open-HMS(WIP)
